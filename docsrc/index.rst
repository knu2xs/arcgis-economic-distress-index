ArcGIS-Economic-Distress-Index Documentation
=============================================================================================================

This documentation is rather simple, the notebook demonstrating how to download data add geometries, and
share the results back to ArcGIS Online. Since using a third party Python package, `CenPy`_, to get data from
the US Census Bureau, even if already using Python  with ArcGIS Pro, we need a Python environment with this
Python package installed.
