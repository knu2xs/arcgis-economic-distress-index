Economic Distress Index Example Mapping Application
===================================================

This is an example web mapping application built using the Feature Layer published from the example notebook included in this
repository. I deliberately did not do much configuration, just let Smart Mapping select the ranges, took advantage of some of
the cartographic capabilities for styling the basemap, and created a quick application embedded here using `Media Map Instant
App template`_.
